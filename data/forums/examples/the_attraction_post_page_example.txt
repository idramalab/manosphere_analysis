    'text_post': " She's an odd one Over the last few weeks/months I've been developing into a bit of a PUA. Previously had been a major AFC.  There's a girl who was a hangover from my AFC days who I always used to text, ring, would generally do anything for. Equally whenever she was on MSN chat, I always used to start chatting. We did go out for a couple of months but she said that she didn't want anything seriously. Foolishly I proceeded to chase her. Lately though I've become much more aloof. I'm largely over her, but she keeps texting me. Also, now it's her that always starts the msn conversations and asks why I keep ignoring her etc. I think she's starting to see me in a different light. What shall I say? Bear in mind I'm still new to this, BUT saying that I never had sex with her so I'd like to do that. She is an HB8.5 after all and it would show how far I've come and would be a great confidence boost. Should I continue to be cold or warm up slightly? I'd also like to know what to say when she accuses me of ignoring her? Thanks ",

    'text_post': " The effect on others of a man transforming from an AFC to a PUA is very visible, and this is a perfect example. Obviously, for her to be chasing you, you are a high value man. I believe (I, too, am developping into a PUA, I'll say what I think, although I don't know if it's the failproof thing to do.) that as long as you dont chase her like you used to, and you keep a frama that you are of higher value and you are the prize, you can say whatever you want.

One thing that is strange is that I used to joke when we were seeing eachother about buying her flowers some day. Now she's talking about when I'm going to get her flowers? How should I respond to something like this? I know that buying them is the worst thing. ",

    'text_post': ' Sorry to tell u this straight up but like for anything else u need more time. U dont become doctor in a day, u dont become a lawyer in a week and u wont become a PUA in a month. In fact I believe stereotyping is always bad. Remember that Noone is \'complete AFC\' or \'complete PUA\' Its all a matter of shades of gray in the middle. U dont know what to say, or what to do. On top of that u need confidence boosts. So try to work on these 3 things in the meanwhile As for the girl. Ur giving her too much importance... "What should I say, what should I do". I dont know if she\'s very sad that uve been ignoring her or not, but even if she was I dont see how u can turn this into an advantage. My serious best advice would be jst go out and meet other girls, and dont waste too much time thinking about \'your situation with a girl who has already rejected u in the past\'. Said that Im pretty sure u wont even take into consideration my advice, cuz yes ur subconscious is still very attracted to her, and ur goal is to get her not to become a better PUA. But as they say trial and error, trial and error. Cheers ',
