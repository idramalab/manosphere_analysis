    'text_post': ' Hey,  I started watching porn around age 12 or 13. First, it was just the normal vanilla stuff, then it became lesbian porn, threesomes, cum compilations and anal sex gang bangs, humiliation etc.  I had a strange masturbation technique as well I preferred, which was to masturbate by putting a high pressure on my penis by just squeezing it between my hand and my stomach, sometimes laying on the stomach and sometimes on the back. I sometimes masturbated up to 5 times a day when I was bored, too. I suffered from delayed ejaculation/anorgasmia with every girl I was with. Even with the girl I loved I could simply not come from sex with her, although I was into it. My dick just didn\'t feel much and as a result, I got bored from just hammering. At that point, it really became a problem for me. I started using viagra and used it many times since, something I will not do again neither. Last year, there was another girl (with some psychological issues) that added another problem. She sometimes indirectly told me my penis was too small ( it is actually 6,3 x 5,4). It seriously destroyed something in me, because if my penis was small, how could I have the kind of sex I desired, really "fucking" a girl? This and other more or less related reasons made me never really get hard on her and I ended it very soon. This was during my abroad studies in Asia and there were other women who barely could take my dick. Another time in a club, some random girl spontaneously grabbed my dick and afterwards showed me the "small" sign with her fingers while smiling. I think these incidents have since made me nervous about a girl touching my dick. When dancing, I avoid cavemanning and when we get down to business I can\'t get it up. I am too stressed out and anxious. My libido has become shit. I couldn\'t get it up for my new years ONS neither. I just can\'t have spontaneous sex it seems. End of the story: I could not, until today, come in the girls I had sex with  and recently, suffer from ED as well. I could come from blowjobs and handjobs recently, but only if I imagined hardcore porn stuff. I have developed some kind of hatred towards sexual girls and I think that all of this is definitely not normal. What the hell can I do about it? ',

    'text_post': ' I agree, good advice in this thread, though I don\'t know about that pegym link.  Seems a bit strange, and btw, the penis is not a muscle.  Not knocking it if it works for guys, but I don\'t think you need to go down a rabbit hole about jelqing and penis exercises right now.  You\'ve got enough going on in your head as it is.  My input: 1) Use ED drugs if you need them.  Don\'t sweat it, lots of guys do.  If you think about it, the sexual demands of modern life are a lot different than what most men of the past had to deal with.  You\'d mostly get a wife at 18 and bang the same woman until you died at 60.  \'Performing\' with a new girl all the time is not something that most of our ancestors probably dealt with.  2) Your penis is for your pleasure.  It\'s your sex organ and it is designed to get you off.  For getting her off, you have your mouth, hands, her hands, vibrators, whatever.   2a) If you aren\'t enjoying what you are doing--if you are banging away and getting bored and aren\'t going to come--feel free to stop and say, "It\'s just not happening for me tonight."  Girls understand not being able to get off, they can\'t always either. 2b) Learn to feel comfortable asking for what you really want in bed.  If you need to fuck her a certain way or have a finger in your ass or whatever to have a good time, say so.  People who openly express their desires without shame are charismatic.  3) Laying off porn and masturbation is a good idea.  Dan Savage, the sex columnist, has answered some questions about this, you might search his archive.  I think he talks about the "death grip"--guys who masturbate with such a tight grip, no vagina can match it.  His advice is to retrain yourself, primarily by just refusing to get off the old way.  Once your body knows the only way it gets to come is with a gentler touch--and once your balls get heavy enough--it\'ll happen. ',

I already workout heavy, I used to live very healthy and workout heavy a few months in a row lately and plan on doing it again, I haven\'t watched porn videos since 8 months, maybe once a week or once every two weeks, I looked at some pictures but that\'s about it. But I also can\'t know if it works because I don\'t have a steady partner. Should be a next priority. Unfortunately, I have no money for a personal trainer. I go to the gym 3 times a week.

    'text_post': " Puck: I had a similar problem. I masturbated in abnormal ways and although I was able to convince 20 or so women to get in bed with me I struggled to get it up every time, and finished very rarely.  I haven't made a full recovery yet, but I can tell you that yourbrainonporn.com has changed how I view the world -- and especially porn.  Honestly man, porn is toxic, and masturbation isn't much better in my opinion. I'm done with both. PM me if you have any more specific questions. To the guys above saying that he's trolling, I can promise you that porn-induced delayed ejaculation is a real growing concern among young men. One of my friends whom I convinced to quit watching porn thanked me last week; he's a totally different guy now. Best of luck! ",
