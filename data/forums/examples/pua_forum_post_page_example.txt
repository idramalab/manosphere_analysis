    'text_post': 'Ok, so I was at a convenient store and I noticed this young woman reading through magazines while I was shopping for some snacks. I caught her eyeing me and when I only glanced for a moment, she darted her eyes away.  I walked passed her and negged her saying "what are you nervous about?" and walked outside. I was using my wifi from outside and later noticed her get in her parked car, which was conveniently parked right where I was standing.  Here is the strange thing. She was sitting in her car for a long time, looking at her phone (but it looked fake) while eyeing me every so often. At one moment, she even put some lip stick or lip gloss on and continued sitting with her phone. My point is that she wasn\'t overly focused on her phone, but almost pretending to be looking at it to see if I would approach her to talk with her again?  She eventually left after like 10 minutes of this. I was tempted to go up and talk to her, but I had a feeling that she would have just been too nervous and acted strange/rejected me if I did hit on her.  I sometimes read that women will put on make up in front of a man either when they are just being defensive and they are letting you know you don\'t have a chance or when they are attracted to you. so it is confusing as hell.  Has anyone been in a situation like this? Where you have noticed a woman giving you attention and looking like she was finding excuses to linger around a while?',

Why not just make something happen instead of standing around being confused?  You heard something could mean this or that...go find out on your own.  The moment one person says she's probably interested then another guy will chime in and say she was ignoring you.  Do what you need to do and quit running back to the forum and asking everyone else to analyze the situation.",

    'text_post': ' Yes, I know what you are saying but I also really hate when women seem to be sending me IOI\'s and then they turn me down not even due to a misunderstanding. I noticed a lot of women will send IOI\'s and then be too shy to back it up and actually talk with me. Other times they are just sending IOI\'s for validation, which is annoying but I know it happens.  I also thought that walking up to a woman while she is in her car seemed creepy and awkward...even if she did in fact send me IOI\'s. Next time I run into this situation, I\'m going to just approach the woman when she is in her car and see how she responds.  Oh yeah, just last night I was walking out of a convenient store and there was a young woman smiling at me as I walked passed her. It was a genuine smile, not some fake one. So I decided to use the wifi out front and wait until she came out to talk with her. Anyway, when she came out, I called her over to me and told her to add me to her Line so we can talk more next time and she just said sorry, no its ok. I don\'t have Line either, goodnight. wtf? Why would she feel the need to give me this big smile and look at me so much as I was leaving if she "wasn\'t interested"? An extreme case of validation seeking?  I don\'t know about you, but I don\'t waste my time smiling at people I have no interest in...some people are strange to me.',

    'text_post': " Well, I figured she was busy and didn't want to be rude. She was chatting with one of the clerks and after noticing me suddenly stopped chatting and looked me right in the eyes and smiled. I knew her conversation with her wasn't actually finished. I realize that I could have said hello, but I go there often and didn't want the clerk (also female) to just stand there and watch me hit on this other chick. It would have probably been awkward as hell.  While moments don't last forever...it does seem a bit ridiculous that her moment of interest couldn't have even lasted literally a couple of minutes lol. Why are women so flaky with such fleeting emotions? If she was truly interested, hence the genuine smile...why would she just betray this feeling 2 minutes later and turn me down? Was it that easy to hurt her pride? I smiled back. That is fucking insane to me. If I like a woman and smile and she doesn't say anything but circles back a couple minutes later, I would never in a million years consider that a reason to shut her down...then again I am a man not a woman.",

But where is the rapport building? Where is any semblance of actual game? It doesn\'t matter what signals you think she is giving you, if you don\'t run proper game you aren\'t going to close very often. It\'s that simple. AND don\'t be a convenient store lurking loser.',
